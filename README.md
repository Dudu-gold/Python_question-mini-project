# Python_question-mini-project

A simple Python project that demonstrates how to build and run a question-based program using **object-oriented programming** and **multiple files**.

The project separates concerns by:
- Defining a `Question` class in one file
- Importing and using that class in another file that contains the questions and game logic

This makes the code easier to read, maintain, and extend.

## 📁 Project Structure

── question_class.py # Contains the Question class
── question.py # Imports the class, defines questions, and runs the program
── README.md

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **`question_class.py`**
   - Defines a `Question` class
   - Each question has:
     - A prompt (the question text)
     - An answer (the correct option)

2. **`question.py`**
   - Imports the `Question` class
   - Creates a list of `Question` objects
   - Contains functions that:
     - Display questions
     - Collect user input
     - Check answers
     - Calculate and display the final score
